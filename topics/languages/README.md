## What Belongs Here

Programming languages and their core ecosystems, including syntax, features, and standard libraries. Examples include:
- General-purpose languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust)
- Web languages (e.g., TypeScript, PHP, Ruby)
- Systems languages (e.g., C, C++, Rust, Zig)
- Functional languages (e.g., Haskell, Elixir, Clojure)
- Query languages (e.g., SQL, GraphQL)
- Markup languages (e.g., HTML, CSS, Markdown)

## Adding a New Language

1. Create a directory for the language: `mkdir <language-name>`
2. Copy the template: `cp ../../.templates/topic-template.md <language-name>/README.md`
3. Fill in all relevant sections
4. Update this README to list the language
5. Update the main repository README and INDEX

## Template Sections to Emphasize

For programming languages, pay special attention to:
- **Key Features**: Paradigms, type system, performance characteristics
- **Use Cases**: Where this language excels
- **Installation/Setup**: How to install compilers/interpreters
- **Common Commands/Usage**: Basic syntax and common patterns
- **Architecture**: How the language works (compiled, interpreted, JIT)
- **Best Practices**: Idiomatic code patterns
- **Resources**: Official documentation, learning resources
